# DIVIDE: Adaptive Context-Aware Query Derivation for IoT Data Streams

This folder contains all supportive material related to the paper "DIVIDE: Adaptive Context-Aware Query Derivation for IoT Data Streams" submitted to the 1st International Workshop on Sensors and Actuators on the Web ([SAW2019](http://saw.gitlab.emse.fr/2019/)) workshop at [ISWC 2019](https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/). This paper is currently under review.

## Contents

In the paper, the DIVIDE system is explained through a running healthcare example. This example is also used for the paper's evaluations.

This folder contains two subfolders:

* [`ontology`](ontology): This folder contains all ontology files used for the running healthcare example. This is a snapshot of the [ACCIO continuous care ontology](https://github.com/IBCNServices/Accio-Ontology/tree/gh-pages). The main ontology file is [`CareRoomMonitoring.ttl`](ontology/CareRoomMonitoring.ttl). All direct and indirect imports of this ontology are also included in the folder. This ontology is also used for the paper's evaluations.
* [`evaluations`](evaluations): This folder contains additional information on the performed evaluations in the paper.
