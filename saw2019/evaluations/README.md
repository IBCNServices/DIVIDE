# DIVIDE: Adaptive Context-Aware Query Derivation for IoT Data Streams

This folder contains supportive material for the evaluations in the paper "DIVIDE: Adaptive Context-Aware Query Derivation for IoT Data Streams", which is submitted to the 1st International Workshop on Sensors and Actuators on the Web ([SAW2019](http://saw.gitlab.emse.fr/2019/)) at [ISWC 2019](https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/). This paper is currently under review.

## Contents

The folder contains supportive material for the following evaluations:

* [`divide-performance`](divide-performance): The material in this folder is related to the performance evaluation of the DIVIDE system itself. It corresponds to the evaluation set-up and results in the Sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the paper ("DIVIDE Performance Evaluation").
* [`real-time-comparison`](real-time-comparison): The material in this folder is related to the evaluation of the real-time processing times of the DIVIDE approach, compared to other alternative approaches that use real-time reasoning. It corresponds to the evaluation set-up and results in the Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the paper ("Comparison of DIVIDE with Real-Time Reasoning Approaches").
