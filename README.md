# DIVIDE: Adaptive Context-Aware Query Derivation for IoT Data Streams

This repository contains code and data related to the DIVIDE system. DIVIDE can serve as a component of a semantic IoT platform. The main goal of DIVIDE is to automatically derive queries for an IoT platform's stream processing components, which filter the IoT data streams. This happens in an adaptive, context-aware way. Whenever the application context changes, DIVIDE can derive the queries that filter the observations of interest for the use case, based on this new or changed context. By performing the reasoning upon context changes, relevant sensors and their observations can be filtered in real-time without the need to perform any more reasoning.

This research is executed at the [IDLab](http://idlab.technology) research group, by people from [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) â€“ [imec](https://www.imec-int.com/en/home).
