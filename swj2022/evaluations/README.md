# Context-aware & privacy-preserving homecare monitoring through adaptive query derivation for IoT data streams with DIVIDE

This folder contains supportive material for the evaluations in the paper "Context-aware & privacy-preserving homecare monitoring through adaptive query derivation for IoT data streams with DIVIDE", which is submitted to the Special Issue on Semantic Web Meets Health Data Management of the Semantic Web Journal.

## Contents

The folder contains supportive material for the following evaluations:

* [`divide-performance`](divide-performance): The material in this folder is related to the performance evaluation of DIVIDE. It corresponds to the evaluation set-up and results in the Sections 8.1 and 9.1 of the paper ("Performance evaluation of DIVIDE").
* [`real-time-comparison`](real-time-comparison): The material in this folder is related to the real-time evaluation of the DIVIDE approach, compared to other alternative approaches that use real-time semantic reasoning. It corresponds to the evaluation set-up and results in the Sections 8.3 and 9.2-3 of the paper ("Real-time evaluation of derived DIVIDE queries").

The context used for the evaluations is represented by the [`context.ttl`](context.ttl) file. This file contains all context triples in RDF/Turtle syntax.
