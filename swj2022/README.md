# Context-aware & privacy-preserving homecare monitoring through adaptive query derivation for IoT data streams with DIVIDE

This folder contains all supportive material related to the paper "Context-aware & privacy-preserving homecare monitoring through adaptive query derivation for IoT data streams with DIVIDE", which is submitted to the Special Issue on Semantic Web Meets Health Data Management of the Semantic Web Journal.

## Contents

In the paper, DIVIDE is explained through a running homecare monitoring example. This example is also used for the paper's evaluations.

This folder contains three subfolders:

* [`ontology`](ontology): This folder contains all files of the Activity Recognition ontology, used for the running homecare monitoring example, that is discussed in the paper. This is a snapshot of the [DAHCC ontology](https://github.com/predict-idlab/DAHCC-Sources), complemented with an ontology file [`KBActivityRecognition.ttl`](ontology/KBActivityRecognition.ttl) that represents all extra definitions related to the knowledge-driven activity recognition. All files in this folder together represent the Activity Recognition ontology. This ontology is also used for the paper's evaluations.
* [`evaluations`](evaluations): This folder contains supportive material related to the evaluations performed in the paper.
* [`eye-implementation`](eye-implementation): This folder contains some more details concerning the implementation of the initialization and query derivation of DIVIDE with the EYE reasoner.
